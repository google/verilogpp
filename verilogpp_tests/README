The files in this directory are used by the verilogpp_tests.t test.

All files with .vpp extensions are processed by the preprocessor to
produce a .v file.  The generated .v output should be identical to
the .vpp file that was used to generate it (verilogpp will strip out
all generated code and regenerate from macros).
